Hi, my name is Samesh Lakhotia and I'm a passionate developer interested in web development, machine learning and tons of other stuff. I love building software, working with tech and solving problems.

I also love doing open source stuff. I am currently working on my Google Summer of Code (2020) project called [hydrus](https://github.com/HTTP-APIs/hydrus).

I am currently an undergrad sophomore year student studying Electronics and Communication engineering at BITS Pilani, Goa campus.
